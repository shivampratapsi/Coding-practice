Question

Rahul is known for copying in exams from his adjacent students, but he's smart
about it. Instead of directly copying the words, he changes the positions of letters
while keeping the letters constant. As the examiner, you need to determine if Rahul
has copied a certain word from the adjacent student who is giving the same exam.
You should provide Rahul with the appropriate markings based on your findings.'

Note:
String is UpperCase

Input Format:
The first line contains the word of the adjacent student.
The second line contains Rahul's words.
Output Format:
0 if Rahul did not copy.
1 if Rahul copied.

Constraints:
1 <= Length of string <= 10^6

Sample Input:
HELLO
EHLLO

Sample Output:
coppied
