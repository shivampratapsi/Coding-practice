  /*
Imagine you're playing a word game with a sentence. Here are the rules:
Rule #1: Create a "Code" for Each Word
For every single word in the sentence, you only care about two letters:
The very first letter.
The very last letter.
You take these two letters and stick them together to make a two-letter "code".
For example:
For the word "good", the code is "gd".
For the word "player", the code is "pr".
For the word "apple", the code is "ae".

Rule #2: Find the Most Popular Code
After you've made a code for every word in the sentence, your main job is to figure out which code appeared the most times.
 You're basically looking for the most frequent one.

The Golden Rule (The Tie-Breaker):
This is the most important part. What if there's a tie? For instance,
what if the code "ae" appears 3 times and the code "pr" also appears 3 times?

The winner is the code that you saw first in the sentence.
